# ksai_anim
This project is a 3D animation and rendering software that is currently under development. It is written in C17, SDL and Vulkan, and it does not use any external libraries or frameworks for graphics. Everything, including the user interface, the font rendering, and the viewport rendering, is done from scratch by the author. The software is intended to be a learning project and a showcase of the author's skills, but it is not yet fully functional or stable. It may have bugs, glitches, or crashes, and it is not recommended for production use.
