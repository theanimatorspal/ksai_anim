# ksai_anim
This project is a 3D animation and rendering software as a submission for Graphics Project of 5th semester (IOE, Pulchowk Campus). It is written in C17, SDL and Vulkan, and it does not use any external libraries or frameworks for graphics. Everything, including the user interface, the font rendering, and the viewport rendering, is done from scratch. The software is intended to be a learning project, but it is not yet fully functional or stable and I guess never will be. It may have bugs, glitches, or crashes, and it is not recommended for production use. 

You cannot even save file and don't have undo feature. It is badly designed as this is the first time I am writing this long code. 12K ULOC (Useless lines of Code).
